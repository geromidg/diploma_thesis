\section{Thesis Summary}

Mention briefly what was discussed in this thesis and what the experiments proved

\section{Contributions}

Mention the research and the development contribution of this thesis

\begin{itemize}
    \item Research contributions (same as objectives of Introduction)
    \item Development contributions (system features):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Suitable for rough terrain navigation by utilizing 2.5D (elevation) maps
            \item Global pose correction using map matching of local (robot-centric) and global (orbiter) elevation maps
            \item Sensor-agnostic data registration using point clouds (support for lidar, stereo camera, ToF camera etc.)
            \item Automatic sensor fusion when multiple inputs are provided (without prior configuration)
            \item Adaptive design to fit the needs of different robots and applications
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Directions for Future Extensions}

Mention future work and possible extensions to the algorithm

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use a discretized particle filter to gain advantage of the grid nature of the map
    \item Use global map for complete (all initial cells) or partial (new unknown cells at the map's edge) of the local map
    \item Use the motion model in addition to using the particle cloud distribution to determine the estimated pose's uncertainty
    \item Use a method (e.g. SOR) to minimize outliers in input point cloud
    \item Apply a threshold to points in projected point cloud that fall in the same map cell
    \item Implement a strategy for selecting a match in template matching when matches with similar score are a. close to each other b. far from each other
\end{itemize}

\section{Applications}

Talk about other possible applications except for the planetary one

\begin{itemize}
    \item Autonomous driving vehicles in urban environment using a priori 3D reconstructed maps (i.e. Google Maps) - although GPS data helps in avoiding the drift of dead reckoning, global map can still be used for local map initialization
    \item Autonomous driving in rough non-urban areas were no predefined paths exists and GPS usage is limited
    \item Lunar teleoperated robot with SLAM for augmenting the operator's perception - processing is done on the station (i.e. ISS) since stereo images are sent anyway
\end{itemize}
