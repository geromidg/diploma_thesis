\chapter{Implementation and Tools}

\section{Planetary Rover Testbed} \label{hdpr_rover}

Explain lab's main rovers (HDPR \& Exoter) and their mechanical/sensor configuration\\
Add figure depicting and explaining the rover(s)

% TODO(ref): HDPR paper

\section{Overall System Architecture}

Explain how the algorithm can be integrated in a system and what components are needed (stereo, odometry etc.)\\
Add component diagram showing the architecture and how the different components are integrated

\section{Library}

Mention GA SLAM library and tools used to create it etc.

\subsection{Robotic Software Framework}

Explain briefly ROCK, its tools, workflow and advantages/disadvantages\\
Explain briefly ROS etc.\\
Mention that the standalone library has interface to both frameworks

% TODO(ref): Rock paper

\subsection{Orbiter Data Preprocessing}

Explain that orbital imagery is emulated using drone imagery\\
Explain quickly how a 3D point cloud is reconstructed from the orbital imagery\\
Mention NASA's HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment)

\bigskip
\noindent
Explain the steps for creating a global map from orbital point cloud:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Voxelize point cloud to the desired resolution
    \item Crop the point cloud in the order of magnitude as local map's size
    \item Smooth the point cloud using a SOR filter
    \item Transform point cloud to robot's pose (using the initial absolute position)
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Add figures of orbiter point cloud (raw \& processed) and the orbiter map\\
Add figures from NASA's HiRISE depicting actual Mars point clouds
